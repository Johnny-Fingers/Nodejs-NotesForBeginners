// ES Module is the modern way to work with modules.
// There are two ways to export and import ES Modules.

// The first one is export a variable/function... specific by its name:
export const days = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "monday"];

// The second one is export by default. It looks like:
/* 
###CODE:
const days = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "monday"];

export default { days } */
